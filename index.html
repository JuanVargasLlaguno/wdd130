        <p>I'm Juan. I'm 23 years old. I lived in Rivera, Uruguay all of my life except for the 2 years I served as a
            missionary

            Uruguay is a country of only 3M people, situated on South America between two of the largest countries in
            the world: Brazil and
            Argentina. Nonetheless, Uruguay has managed to achieve incredible feats at world level. Most notably
            Uruguay's national soccer
            team has won the World Cup 2 times (with other 2 World titles prior) and is also the current champion on the
            sub-20 category, despite having less population on the whole country than some nearby cities like Buenos
            Aires.
            The capital, Montevideo, is at the south of the country, bordering with the Rio de la Plata. It has amazing
            beaches and many turistic spots.
            53% of Uruguay's population lives in Montevideo.
