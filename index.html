            <p>
                Uruguay is a country of only 3M people, situated on South America between two of the largest countries
                in
                the world: Brazil and
                Argentina. Nonetheless, Uruguay has managed to achieve incredible feats at world level. Most notably
                Uruguay's national soccer
                team has won the World Cup 2 times (with other 2 World titles prior) and is also the current champion on
                the
                sub-20 category, despite having less population on the whole country than some nearby cities like Buenos
                Aires.
                The capital, Montevideo, is at the south of the country, bordering with the Rio de la Plata. It has
                amazing
                beaches and many turistic spots.
                53% of Uruguay's population lives in Montevideo.
